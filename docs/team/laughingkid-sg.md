### Project: SoC InternApply

SoC InternApply - SoC InternApply helps CS students to track internship applications they are interested in. It is optimised for users who prefer CLI and have a lot of company applications and their associated tasks to keep track of. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added ability to add and manage interview dates to internship application. 
  * What it does: Allows the user to add an interview date to each application. 
  * Justification: Users will have multiple ongoing internship applications at the same time and we want to provide a useful way for users to track their upcoming applications.

* **New Feature**: Added ability to sort by name, interview date, priority, status 
  * What it does: Allows the user to sort by the above fields in ascending and descending order.
  * Justification: This feature allows users to order their applications according to key fields to allow for more efficient access and management of their internship applications. 

* **Code contributed**: 
  * 1200+ LoC contributed to the project. See [RepoSense](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=laughingkid-sg&breakdown=true&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2022-02-18&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other).
  * Updated test cases details from contact details (original AB3) to the internship applications. [#58](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/pull/58), [#88](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/pull/88)

  * Setup weekly zoom meetings and set the agenda of meetings.
  * Frequently clarified minor details such as implementation and raise possible conflicts.
  * Suggested standards for naming and documentation details for branching, issues and pull requests. 

  * **Contributions to team-based tasks**:
     * Updated Gradle.
       1.  Enable assertions.
       2.  Updated JAR file build output file name.
     * Milestone and release management.
