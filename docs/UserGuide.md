SoC InternApply (SIA) is a **desktop app for managing internship applications, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, SIA can get your internship application management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

With SoC InternApply, you can easily add an application, edit it later on if there are any changes needed, find the applications based on keywords and also sort them based on priority, interview date and much more! All while not having to worry about saving or storing your applications as this is done internally and automatically by SoC InternApply.

Ultimately, with SoC InternApply, you can worry less about the administrative tasks and focus more on preparing for the interviews themselves!

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer. You can download it from [this website](https://www.oracle.com/sg/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html).

2. Download the latest `internapply.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _root folder_ for your SIA (e.g. you can save it in your desktop or downloads folder). <br>
   **Note:** There will be data (your internship applications) stored into this same folder, but it would not take up much space.

4. Double-click the jar file to start the app. The GUI similar to the diagram below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data. Do note that for Linux OS, you may have to enable double-click to run JAR files first!<br><br>

   ![Ui](images/MainWindowUi.png)

5. Another reminder window should appear automatically similar to the below. Note that this window **would contain any upcoming interviews you have in a weeks time**.<br>

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/Grab SG`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/Grab SG t/local` or as `n/Grab SG`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/local` or `t/local t/NUS` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `j/Software Engineer j/Data Scientist`, only `j/Data Scientist` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `reminder`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

**:information_source: Notes about duplicate applications:**<br>

* Duplicate applications are not allowed.

* Applications are considered duplicates if they have the same name, job title and optional tags.

* Name, job title and optional tags are case-sensitive.
  e.g. The name `Shopee` is considered different from `shopee`.

* Ordering of optional tags do not matter.
  e.g. `tag1`, `tag2`, `tag3` is considered the same as `tag3`, `tag1`, `tag2`.

* Refer to FAQ for adding multiple applications to the same job.

- DETAILS
  - You can add details to the application by using `d/DETAILS`
  - You can enter new lines in the details input by using `\n`
  - You  can remove `DETAILS` by typing `d/` without any strings following it, which will revert the field back to the default of `To add details, use the edit command`
  - To edit the details of an application, you can follow this format (adding \n to type in a new line): `edit 1 d/Example details \nThis is a newline of the details`<br>e.g.`edit 1 d/This company requires a preliminary coding round.\n I should practice more on HackerRank` will result in this details being added:
```
This company requires a preliminary coding round.

- `edit 1 t/Singapore ast/APPLIED` Edits the tags and application status tag of the 1st application to Singapore and APPLIED respectively. Since the priority tag is not specified, the 1st application will keep its current priority tag if it had any.


#### Advanced Function

Removing Tags from existing application.

**CAUTION**: While it is possible to use these special Tags while editing other fields of an existing application in SoC InternApply, we highly recommend not doing so unless you know what you are doing. However, if you wish to do so please refer to the description below beforehand.

**Format**: `edit INDEX [t/removetags] [t/removepriority] [t/removestatus]`

- Removes the Tags from an existing application.
- `[t/removetags]` will remove all Optional Tags from an application (i.e. Tags with the prefix `t/`).
- `[t/removepriority]` will remove the Priority Tags from an application (i.e. Tags with the prefix `pt/`).
- `[t/removestatus]` will remove the Application Status Tags from an application (i.e. Tags with the prefix `ast/`).
- These special Tags are not case-sensitive (i.e. typing `t/ReMOveTagS` would also work). 
- These special Tags cannot be used as a valid Optional Tag for your applications.
- These special Tags can be used in any order, and you can either use 1 of them, a pair of them, or all 3 of them.
- These special Tags takes precedence over all other Tag inputs. Refer to the Example usage below for reference.
- You can still use these special Tags even if the respective Tags do not exist for the specified application. Nothing will happen in this case.
- If removing any of the Tags from an application causes it to become a duplicate application the command will be invalid. Please refer to our Notes about duplicate applications

**Example usages and expected outcomes**

- `edit 1 t/removetags t/removepriority` Removes all the Optional Tags and the Priority Tag from the 1st application.
- `edit 1 p/65258719 t/removestatus` Removes the Application Status Tag from the 1st application. Edits the phone number of the 1st application to be `65258719`
- `edit 1 pt/HIGH t/removepriority` Special Tags takes precedence over all other Tag inputs. Removes the Priority Tag from the 1st application. Ignores the `pt/HIGH` input.
- `edit 1 t/removestatus t/Singapore t/ExEmployee` Special Tags takes precedence over all other Tag inputs. Removes the Application Status Tag from the 1st application. Ignores the `t/Singapore t/ExEmployee` inputs.
- `edit 1 t/removestatus` followed by `edit 1 t/removestatus` First removes the Application Status Tag from the 1st application. Then does nothing since there does not exist an Application Status Tag for the 1st application.

### Finding application(s): `find`

Finds existing applications in SoC InternApply.

**Format:** `find [n/NAME] or find [j/JOB_TITLE] or find [t/TAG]... or find [pt/PRIORITY_TAG] or find [ast/APPLICATION_STATUS_TAG]`
- Finds the applications with the fields containing keywords given in the input (partial keywords accepted as well).
- Keywords are case-insensitive.
- Parameters are only expected once (except tags). e.g. `find n/shopee n/grab` is equivalent to `find n/grab`, the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.
- However, for `n/` and `j`, more than 1 word can be accepted per field i.e. `find n/aftershock pc` will display any application with the name `aftershock` or `pc`. 
- If more than 1 different fields are given, i.e. `find n/shopee j/ML`, only the first field (in the sequence of [n/NAME], [j/JOB_TITLE], [t/TAG]..., [pt/PRIORITY_TAG], [ast/APPLICATION_STATUS_TAG]) will be processed, i.e. `find n/shopee j/ML` is the same as `find n/shopee`, `find j/ML n/shopee` is also the same as `find n/shopee`

**Example usages and expected outcomes:**
- `find n/shopee` finds and displays all applications with "Shopee" in its name.
- `find j/ML` finds and displays all applications with "ML" in its job title.
- `find pt/HIGH` finds and displays all applications with "HIGH" in its priority tag.
- `find ast/applied` finds and displays all applications with "applied" in its application status. (note that it is case-insensitive)
- `find t/overseas` finds and displays all applications with "overseas" in its tags.
- `find t/overseas t/USA` finds and displays all applications with "overseas" or "USA" in its tags.

### Listing all applications (with / without sorting): `list`

#### List all applications (with sorting)

Sorts the list of all applications in SoC InternApply based on the provided parameters.

**Format:** `list [sorting paramter] [order by]`

Sorting parameters:
- `name` : Sort by name of the company in alphabetical order starting with A in ascending order.
- `interview` : Sort by interview date of applications starting with the latest earliest date.
- `priority` : Sort by priority in the following ascending order - <NO_TAG>, LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH.
- `status` : Sort by status in the following ascending order - <NO_TAG>, ACCEPTED, REJECTED, INTERVIEWED, APPLIED and NOT_APPLIED.

* If optional fields (i.e. interview date and time, priority, status) do not exist in that certain application, that application will be considered at the bottom of the sorting order. If there is more than one application have similar fields, the company `name` of the application will be used as tiebreak to sort alphabetically (i.e. Application 1 with company name `AAA` and `HIGH` priority and Application 2 with company name `BBB` and `HIGH` priority are sorted by priority in ascending order — Application 1 will be ranked higher than Application 2).

Order by:
- `asc` : Order by ascending.
- `desc` : Order by descending (reverse order of ascending).

Examples:
* `list interview desc`
* `list name desc`, running this will output:
  <br>
```
Sorted applications by name order by desc.
```

> 💡 `list` command with parameters only considers the first two parameters if and only if the first two parameters are valid.
> - `list status desc` — Valid, sorted by `status` in descending order
> - `list abc status asc` — Invalid
> - `list status asc name desc` — Valid, sorted by `status` in ascending order

> 💡 Upper case and lower case name are consider as same ranking (i.e. Application 1 with company name `aaa` will be ranked above Application 2 with company name `BBB` when sorted by `name` in ascending order).

> ⚠️ Applications are originally sorted in a chronological order base on create date and time. Do take note that after using the `list` feature to sort, you will not be able to sort the applications in chronological order.

#### List all applications (without sorting)

The `list` command also works without parameters. It will show the list in the last sorted order used by the user. This is used after using the `find` feature to list out all applications.

Example:
* `list`

```
Listed all application(s).
```

> 💡 `list` command without parameters only works if and only if you do not provide parameters.

> ❗ Sorting will not apply to newly added or newly edited applications. Please re-run the `list` command with the respective parameters to sort as you like.

## FAQ
**Q**: How do I know where my internship applications data is stored?<br>
**A**: Please locate where SoC InternApply is being stored on your computer. You will see a folder named `data` found in the root folder of the application (the folder containing SoC InternApply) Inside the `data` folder, you can find a data file named `internapplymemory.json`, which stores all the applications.

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**: Refer to the 1st QnA to locate the data file. Install the app in the other computer. Copy the contents of the data file of SoC InternApply from your previous computer and paste it in the empty data file of SoC InternApply of the new computer. <br>

**Q**: When I run SIA for the first time, I do not see any of the sample application. How can I get the sample applications to appear in SIA? <br>
**A**: Refer to the 1st QnA to locate the `data` folder. Delete any existing files in the `data` folder and run SoC InternApply again.

**Q**: I have an existing application to a company that I applied to where I got rejected and I am trying to reapply to the same company with the exact same details. Since SIA cannot have duplicate applications, what should I do? <br>
**A**: <br>
Option 1: Using edit, you can simply reuse the existing application with updated information. <br>
Option 2: If you are looking to keep the existing application and it's information untouched, then we suggest including an additional "t/NthAttempt" to differentiate your new application and the existing application. This will not violate our duplication clause while also allowing you to keep information on your existing application.

**Q**: How many applications can SIA track?<br>
**A**: 2147483647 applications can be tracked.

**Q**: When I use `find` followed by `edit` sometimes the application that I edited disappears form the main window. Am I doing something wrong?<br>
**A**: This can happen when you `find` applications with a specific field like `NAME` and then `edit` the `NAME` of an application that you found to something that no longer meets the criteria of the `find` command.<br>
For example, if you call `find n/Grab` followed by `edit 1 n/Shopee` the 1st application will disappear since it is no longer an application with a `NAME` containing `Grab`

**Q**: Why am I unable to use the `idt/` command to add the interview date when I add an application?
**A**: The `idt/` is excluded from the `add` command specifically to prevent possible user mistake(s). You should add an application before apply it. Hence, at the point of time when adding the application, you will not have recieve an interview slot.

**Q**: How can I retrieve the original(created date and time) sorting order?
**A**: Unfortunately due to the current limitations of our application, you will not be able to sort by the application by the create date and time. This means that once you have use the sorting feature, the original order will be lost forever.
